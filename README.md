# Sterling AI multi-agent orchestration demo

A sales demo in which several AI agents, under an Orchestrator, take a business request from intake to a reviewed deliverable that a human approves. Read `CLAUDE.md` first.

Slice S1, the event spine and stubbed loop, is built. Every run on the Demo page comes from stubbed agents with no model calls. The page renders only from the event stream.

## Run it

```
uv sync
set PYTHONUTF8=1
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000/demo. The full validation walk-through is in `specs/001-event-spine-stubbed-loop/quickstart.md`.

## Check it

```
uv run python scripts/check.py      # ruff, format, mypy, tests, em-dash lint, .env leak test
uv run playwright install chromium  # once
uv run pytest -m visual             # screenshot comparison and browser end-to-end tests
```
